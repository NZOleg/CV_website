		<h1>
			My Background
		</h1>
		<p>
			I am very detail oriented. You can easily contact me at any hour of the day. I work very, very hard.
			I know how to deliver on time and on budget. I have business savvy. I work well with remote teams.
		</p>
		<p></p>
		As a full stack engineer, I have demonstrated my ability to crush it on both the front end and back end. I am fluent in Ruby and JavaScript. I am also quite competent with many modern frameworks such as React, Redux, Rails and Node. I love to code and am so happy that I get to learn and create new things every day!

		I come from humble beginnings in the countryside of Warren County, New Jersey . I always had a strong desire to understand how the world worked and also to create, so I studied earth science and education in college and became a teacher in New York City shortly after graduating. I taught science for seven years to students in grades 8 - 12. Students generally agreed that my class was 'lit'. Eventually I realized that I missed being creative so I got back into coding with HTML and CSS, a hobby I'd had since I was a kid on Xanga, and began learning JavaScript. I immediately knew that coding was something I could do every day for the rest of my life.

		I am also passionate about technology, our planet, travel and making people laugh. I am currently a lead web development instructor at C4Q  but I'm looking forward to finding a role where I can help build real products that people love. Let me know if you're interested!


		I have a logical mind with a practical approach to problem solving and a drive to see things through to completion. Iâ€™m friendly and love to help others. I am eager to learn, I enjoy overcoming challenges and I have a genuine interest in all things IT.

		I have a loving family and enjoy good food. To give my best I need encouragement and a friendly workplace.
